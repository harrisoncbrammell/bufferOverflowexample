# bufferOverflowexample
This is a simple c 99 program that is vulnerable to a buffer overflow thru the input string taken from the console. The purpose is for use in learning to debug and write exploits.
In this repository, you will find a pe file, an elf file, and the source code so you can ehtier compile it yourself or use the pre compiled files along with the source code to dive into the world of binary exploitation.
